  <div class="hello">
    <h1>I'm Dominik Kołodziej</h1>
    <p>
      I am a student filled with a passion for self-development. I live in Krakow, the city that still I want to explore.
    </p>
    <p>
      I received my BSc degree in  Computer Science at AGH University of Science and Technology in 2021. While studying I have actively participated in the student organization BEST AGH Kraków and organized events for students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programming is not only my field of study and source of income- I would like to make the world a little more interesting with the help of modern technologies.
